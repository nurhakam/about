This is my first attempt to learning CSS and HTML back in the day, not so pretty but it's got me small spark to learn web development.

## Lesson learned

Just start wherever you are, learn by doing. If you don't know what to do in life and find something you enjoy, pursue it. Don't afraid to what comes in the future, afraid that you not doing what you really want. If you like code, persuing computer science is good choice.
